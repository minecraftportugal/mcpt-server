#################

# If we break things, you can disable it here.

# Disabling this will stop SkinsRestorer from changing skins when a player loads a server resource pack.
# When a player loads a server resource pack, their skin is reset. By default, SkinsRestorer reapplies the skin when the player reports that the resource pack has been loaded or an error has occurred.
ResourcePackFix: true

# Dismounts a mounted (on a horse, or sitting) player when their skin is updated, preventing players from becoming desynced.
# File override = ./plugins/SkinsRestorer/disableDismountPlayer.txt
DismountPlayerOnSkinUpdate: true

# Remounts a player that was dismounted after a skin update (above option must be true).
# Disabling this is only recommended if you use plugins that allow you ride other players, or use sit. Otherwise you could get errors or players could be kicked for flying.
# File override = ./plugins/SkinsRestorer/disableRemountPlayer.txt
RemountPlayerOnSkinUpdate: true

# Dismounts all passengers mounting a player (such as plugins that let you ride another player), preventing those players from becoming desynced.
# File override = ./plugins/SkinsRestorer/enableDismountEntities.txt
DismountPassengersOnSkinUpdate: false

# <!! Warning !!>
# Enable this will require players to run "/skin update" to update their skin.
DisallowAutoUpdateSkin: false

# <!! Warning Experimental !!>
# This enables the experimental PaperMC join event integration that allows instant skins on join.
# It is not as tested as the default implementation, but it is smoother and should not lag the server.
# It also fixes all resource pack skin apply issues.
# If your players are experiencing extremely long loading screens, try disabling this.
EnablePaperJoinListener: true

# <!! Warning !!>
# When enabled if a skin gets applied on the proxy, the new texture will be forwarded to the backend as well.
# This is optional sometimes as the backend may pick up the new one of the proxy.
# It is recommended though to **KEEP THIS ON** because it keeps the backend data in sync.
# This feature is required for solutions like RedisBungee and also fixes bugs in some cases.
ForwardTextures: true
